    "Let's say the \"frequency state\" of a deck is the number of cards of each face value remaining. A full deck, for example, has the frequency state \"4 aces, 4 twos, 4 threes...,\" while an empty deck has the frequency state \"0 aces, 0 twos, 0 threes....\" There are $5^{13}$ possible frequency states. When you draw a card from a deck, the frequency state changes in a way that depends only on the face value of the card you drew.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can turn the set of possible frequency states into a [directed graph][1] by drawing an arrow for each way the frequency state can change when you draw a card. I'll call this graph the \"draw graph.\" Each vertex in the draw graph has at most 13 edges leaving it, one for each type of card you could draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can turn the draw graph into a [weighted][2] directed graph by assuming that cards are drawn uniformly at random, and weighting each arrow by the probability of that kind of draw. The full-deck state, for example, has 13 arrows leaving it, each with weight $\\frac{1}{13}$. If you draw a queen, you end up in a state that still has 13 arrows leaving it, but 12 of them have weight $\\frac{4}{51}$, and one—the arrow for drawing another queen—has weight $\\frac{3}{51}$. The weights of the arrows leaving each state add up to one, so the draw graph is a [Markov chain][3].\n",
